= Building Phantom =

== Basic build ==

Make sure you have PHANTOM_HOME environment variable, makefiles depend on it.

'''make all''' in root dir makes all C sources.

It does not make tests, tools or .ph/.java sources for Phantom userland. Those are pre-built.

== Making tools ==

cd tools

Currently no common way exist. Most tools can be made either with Eclipse (Java sources) or plain make (C sources).

Most tools must be pre-compiled and put to '''build/bin''' or '''build/jar''' directories. You don't have to compile java code if you're not working on it, as it wil run in any environment unchanged.

== Non-Intel ==

In '''local-config.mk''' add:

* ARCH=ia32 - works
* ARCH=arm - not thumb! original 32-bit ARM, tests pass, no drivers
* ARCH=mips - not all tests pass
* ARCH=amd64 - not even compiles
