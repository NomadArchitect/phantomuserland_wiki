Kolibri is an extremely simple and lightweight OS with a terrible architecture. Or, to say truth, no arcgitecture at all.
Nevertheless, emulating Kolibri usermode environment was interesting and funny experience and helped a bit to structure kernel code better.

Kolibri fans are welcome to help this subsystem growing.
