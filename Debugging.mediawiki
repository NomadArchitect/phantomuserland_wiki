= Debugging =

== pvm_test + gdb ==

```
cd phantom/vm
gdb pvm_test
```

Can be useful to debug virtual machine.

== QEMU + gdb ==

When running kernel in QEMU it is possible to connnect with gdb. 

```
cd oldtree/kernel/phantom
# make sure gdb can execute .gdbinit here
gdb
```

gdb will load symbols and connect to running kernel.

== PDB Phantom Debugger ==

There is a Java application in tools/pdb, which can connect to running '''pvm_test''' 
(and should be able to connect to running kernel also) and let one to browse persistent 
memory objects.

See '''phantom/vm/gdb.c''' for connector.
